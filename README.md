# wxToneGen
#### (GPL 2.0)
C++ Tone generator using [Audiere](http://audiere.sourceforge.net/) API (windows only) and [wxWidgets](http://wxwidgets.org/) 2.8 framework for GUI with treeview and tabs.
*- The great IDE [CodeBlocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) was used for this project.*


### TODO :
- *Update wxWidgets version and use newer features*
- *Use [JUCE](http://www.juce.com/) instead, for portability*
- *Improve code*
- *Clean up code*
